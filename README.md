# TraySense
**TraySense** is a Windows tray application for monitoring battery level of a DualSense (PS5) controller.

Features:
- Works over usb and bluetooth !
- Shows a "Battery low" Notification.
- Dark mode and Light mode icons (automatic).  


> [!NOTE]
Tested on Windows 10 and with only one DualSense (firmware A-0520) as i do not own two DS controllers.  
This program requires .NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime to run , if not installed on your device Windows should prompt to do so automatically.
